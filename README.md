This project was wrіttеn on jQuery, SCSS, HTML and has a simple interface. Index.html is the main file to run.

Short instruction of how to use the application:

In the top block we see 3 buttons: "left", "right" - to rotate domino, "new" - to reset settings. To change numbers of bone points, click on a half of a bone and click on left menu button with the needed number. Bottom sliders configure the speed of rotation and scale the size of bone.
